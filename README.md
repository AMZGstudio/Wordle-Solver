# Wordle-Solver
This is a Wordle Solver, its used by going to a wordle website
(it doesn't have to be the offical website, but it works better there)
and following the instructions on the screen, so start with 'arise'
and input your results, note: you dont have to start with arise, its just best to.

then depending on the colors you got, lets say â¬œðŸŸ©â¬œðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ¨ is your result, you input
'bgbyy'. B stands for Black (or empty), G is for green, and Y is for yellow.

Note: if you mistype, you are going to have to reopen the solver, and start from the
begining.

When all thats done, you can type in one of its 'top picks' or you can enter one of the
other words that are available.
